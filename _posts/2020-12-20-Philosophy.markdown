### Who need philosophy?

A philosophy is a great guide to keeping practice aligned with some specific goals that you will appreciate.

My philosophy for umx is that it should function as a domain specific language for causality.

My guides are that it should help you:

1. Decide what you want to do.
2. Tightening that decision into a correct implementation and workflow (programming model comparisons).
3. Get results and communicate them.

This means I try to provide an active vocabulary of functions that make these three things as fast as possible.

As a result, there are things you can't do. But that's an explicit goal. R has to many cases where "you can do it lots of ways".

With umx, I want to pick out a beautiful vocabulary to get this one thing done as quickly and powerfully as possible.

That's it :-)
