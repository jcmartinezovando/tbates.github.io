### A domain specific language for causality?

A principle can be a great guide to keeping practice aligned with some specific goals that you will appreciate.

Our principle in designing `umx` is that it should function as a *domain specific language for causality*.

It should help you:

1. Formulate models expressing competing models of causes and effects.
2. Encourage falsifying competing theories
3. Encourage a reproducible and correct implementation and workflow.
4. Get results and communicate them.

Do this end, we try and provide a compact active vocabulary of functions that doing these four things as fast as possible.

As a result, there are things you can't do. But that's an explicit goal. R has too many cases where "you can do it lots of ways".

With umx, the goal it to create a small vocabulary to get this one thing done as quickly and powerfully as possible.

That's it :-) On to the modeling!
