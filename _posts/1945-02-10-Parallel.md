#### This page is not finished. When done it will explain turning on parallel in OpenMx

Modern CPUs often contain multiple real cores (processing units that share memory), and a PC may contain more than one CPU.
Some of these cores may be "virtual": software cores which help allow the compiler to keep the hardware working while one process is data limited.

In OpenMx, you find how many cores are available have using `omxDetectCores()`.

Out of the box, OpenMx uses `omxDetectCores() - 1`.

You can change this using an option

```splus
mxOption(model, "Number of Threads", cores)
```

When you are not setting a default rather than a model's option, you need to supply NULL to model. You need to remember the correct option string, and cores doesn't have an easy default.

umx supplements this with

```splus
umx_set_cores() # defaults to max-1
umx_get_cores() # how many cores are we currently requesting?

```

You may find this easier, especially with textmate's bundle or R's function completion (just type `umx_` and tab to see the listâ€¦):

So this

```splus
umx_set_cores() # defaults to max-1
```

is equivalent to:

```splus
mxOption(NULL, "Number of Threads", omxDetectCores() - 1)
```

and this

```splus
umx_get_cores() # how many cores are we currently requesting?
```

to this

```splus
mxOption(NULL, "Number of Threads")

```



```splus
data(myFADataRaw, package="OpenMx")
manifests = names(myFADataRaw)
m1 <- umxRAM("m1",
	umxPath(from = "g", to = manifests),
	umxPath(from = c("x1", "x2"), to = "x3"),
	# set means and vars of latents and manifests
	
	umxPath(v1m0 = "g"),
	umxPath(var = manifests),
	umxPath(means = manifests),
	data = mxData(myFADataRaw, type = "raw")
)
m1 = umxRun(m1, setLabels = T, setValues = T)
umxSummary(m1); umx_show(m1)

# the manifest variables loading on each proposed latent variable
Spatial   <- c("visual" , "cubes"   , "paper") 
Verbal    <- c("general", "paragrap", "sentence")
Math      <- c("numeric", "series"  , "arithmet")

m2 <- umxRAM("Holzinger_and_Swineford1939",
    # Define the three latents and allow them to covary
	umxPath("vis" , to = Spatial),
    umxPath("math", to = Math), 
    umxPath("text", to = Verbal),
    umxPath(unique.bivariate = c("vis" ,"math", "text")),
    # umxPath(var = "math", fixedAt = 1.0),
    umxPath(var = c("math", "vis", "text"), fixedAt = 1.0), 
    umxPath(var = c(Math, Verbal, Spatial)), #manifest residuals 
	data = mxData(HS.fake.data, type = "raw")
) 
umx_show(m2)
m2 <- mxRun(m2) # run the model
plot(m2)
