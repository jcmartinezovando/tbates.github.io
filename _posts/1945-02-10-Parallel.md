#### This page is not finished. When done it will explain turning on parallel in OpenMx

Modern CPUs typically contain multiple real cores (processing units that share memory), and a PC may contain more than one CPU.
Some chips also implement "virtual" cores which help allow the compiler to keep the hardware working while one process is data limited.

You can see how many cores R can see using `detectCores()` (on my 2015 MacBook, the answer is 4)

Out of the box, OpenMx uses `mxDetectCores() - 1` to execute in parallel on supported OS's.

You can change this using an option

```splus
mxOption(NULL, "Number of Threads", n)
```

This involves remembering the correct option string.

umx supplements this with

```splus
umx_set_cores() # defaults to max-1
umx_get_cores() # how many cores are we currently requesting?

```

You may find `umx_set_cores` easier, especially with the [TextMate](http://macromates.com) bundle or R's function completion (just type `umx_` and tab to see the listâ€¦):

So this

```splus
umx_set_cores() # defaults to max-1
```

is equivalent to:

```splus
mxOption(NULL, "Number of Threads", detectCores() - 1)
```

Multiple cores are expected on all platforms during 2016, and work to dramactically speed up time consuming processing, like CIs.
