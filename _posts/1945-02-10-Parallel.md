#### This page is not finished. When done it will explain turning on parallel in OpenMx

```splus
data(myFADataRaw, package="OpenMx")

m1 <- umxRAM("m1",
	umxPath(from = "g", to = manifests),
	umxPath(from = c("x1", "x2"), to = "x3"),
	# set means and vars of latents and manifests
	
	umxPath(v1m0 = "g"),
	umxPath(var = manifests),
	umxPath(means = manifests),
	data = mxData(myFADataRaw, type = "raw")
)
m1 = umxRun(m1, setLabels = T, setValues = T)
umxSummary(m1); umx_show(m1)

# the manifest variables loading on each proposed latent variable
