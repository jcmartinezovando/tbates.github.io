Mplus is a widely used statistical modelling package. Mini opening excuses, therefore, will be familiar with this syntax.
The purpose of this tutorial is to show how to translate your knowledge of the text-based in Mplus syntax into OpenMx path-based models.

*Disclaimer*: I am not an Mplus user: I've never published a single article using their code. This is based on reading Mplus examples.
 
### Mplus Commands

In [MPLUS command file](http://www.statmodel.com/language.html) is made up of 9 Mplus commands:

| MPlus command       | openMxequivalent                   |
|:--------------------|:-----------------------------------|
| TITLE               | Any helpful text in an R comment   |
| DATA (required)     | mxData sourced as you wish         |
| VARIABLE (required) | names of data columns you will use |
| ANALYSIS            | The type of analysis you specify   |
| DEFINE              | openMxequivalent                   |
| SAVEDATA            | use R functions to save            |
| MODEL               | openMxequivalent                   |
| OUTPUT              | Access elements of the summary     |
| MONTECARLO          | openMxequivalent                   |


```splus
    
    TITLE: Grant-White School: Summary Statistics
    
    DATA: FILE IS D:\Mplus\grant.dat ;
          FORMAT IS free ;
    
    
    VARIABLE:
          NAMES ARE visperc
    	            cubes
    				lozenges
    				paragrap
    				sentence
    				wordmean
    				gender ;
    USEVARIABLES ARE visperc
                     cubes
                     lozenges
                     paragrap
      				 sentence
    				 wordmean
    USEOBS gender EQ 1 ;
    ANALYSIS: TYPE = basic ;

```

### Expressing paths in OpenMx for Mplus users.

| MPlus | example  | OpenMx                            |
|:------|:---------|:----------------------------------|
| ON    | A ON B   | mxPath("A", to = "B")             |
| BY    | A BY B   | mxPath("B", to = "A")             |
| WITH  | A WITH B | mxPath("A", to = "B", arrows = 2) |


```splus

# ==========================================

require(umx); data(HS.ability.data)
manifests = c("visual", "cubes", "flags", "paragrap", "sentence", "wordm") # our copy of the file has slightly different variable names
umx_check_names(manifests, data = HS.ability.data)
myData = subset(HS.ability.data, subset = Gender == 1, select = manifests)

umxBasic <- function(myData){
	m2 <- umxRAM("Grant_White Summary", data = myData,
	
	
	)
	m2 = mxRun(m2); umxSummary(m2)

}

umxEFA <- function(name = "EFA", factors = c(1,2), data = myData){
	m2 <- umxRAM(name, data = myData,
	
	
	)
	m2 = mxRun(m2); umxSummary(m2)
	
}

### Notes to me about Mplus syntax
Mplus allows these to appear in any order.

Each command begins on a new line and must terminate with a colon.

Option(s) are separated by Semicolons.

### Models to add on request
1. Linear regression with multivariate outcomes
1. Probit regression for binary and ordered categorical variables with multivariate outcomes
1. Logistic regression for binary, ordered, and unordered categorical variables
1. Path analysis
1. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis
1. Confirmatory factor analysis with covariates
1. General structural equation modeling
1. Growth modeling
1. Multilevel modeling
1. General latent variable mixture modeling
