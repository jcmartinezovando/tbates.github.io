### Commands
An [MPLUS command file](http://www.statmodel.com/language.html) is made up of 9 Mplus commands:

| MPlus command       | openMxequivalent                   |
|:--------------------|:-----------------------------------|
| TITLE               | Any helpful text in an R comment   |
| DATA (required)     | mxData sourced as you wish         |
| VARIABLE (required) | names of data columns you will use |
| ANALYSIS            | The type of analysis you specify   |
| DEFINE              | openMxequivalent                   |
| SAVEDATA            | use R functions to save            |
| MODEL               | openMxequivalent                   |
| OUTPUT              | Access elements of the summary     |
| MONTECARLO          | openMxequivalent                   |


Mplus allows these to appear in any order. Each command begins on a new line and must terminate with a colon. Option(s) are separated by Semicolons.
