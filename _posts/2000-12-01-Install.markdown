### Installing umx (and OpenMx)

It's easy to learn and easy to get print-ready results from models. But first you need to install OpenMx and the umx library.

``` splus
install.packages("OpenMx")
library("OpenMx")
```

### Install umx
umx lives on [github](http://github.com/tbates/umx) â€“ a great place for package development. Loading libraries from github differs slightly from the procedure you may be used to. instead of `install.packages("umx")`, we're going to use `devtools::install_github("umx")` [^1]

``` splus
# install & load newish devtools
install.packages("devtools")
library("devtools")
# install and load umx
install_github("tbates/umx")
library("umx")
# get going :-)
?umx
```

On windows you might need

``` splus
install_github("umx", username = "tbates", args = "--no-multiarch")
```

On old versions of devtools you might need

``` splus
install_github("umx", username = "tbates")	
```
