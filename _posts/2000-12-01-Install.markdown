### Installing umx (and OpenMx)

It's easy to learn and easy to get print-ready results from models. Sweet huh? Installation is easy (look left)

### Install umx

``` splus
# install & load newish devtools
install.packages("devtools")
library("devtools")
# install and load umx
install_github("tbates/umx")
library("umx")
# get going :-)
?umx
```

On windows you might need

``` splus
install_github("umx", username = "tbates", args = "--no-multiarch")
```

On old versions of devtools you might need

``` splus
install_github("umx", username = "tbates")	
```
