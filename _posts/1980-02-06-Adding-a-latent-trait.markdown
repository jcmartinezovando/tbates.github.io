Until now, to keep things simple as we learn, We have never had anything but never measured variables (boxes) on the diagram.

Of course,Much of the power ofStruggle? Opening mix comes from the ability to create latent traits. These are represented on the diagram as circles. Conceptually, they are usually thought of as theoretical constructs which explain the existence of a measured variables.

So we mention that, While we never see someone's extraversion, that is what explains the fact that people's desire to go to a party, whether they like most people they meet, whether they often want to do something, and tend to talk a lot all "hang togther" or covary.
